# MyxoSSU
A Manually-curated Database for Bright and Dark-spored Myxomycetes based on the 18S rRNA gene

This database contains 1,103 extracted 18S SSU rRNA gene sequences with representatives from both bright and dark-spored clades. 
Sequences included in this database were retrieved from peer-reviewed barcoding studies and were manually classified based on the authoritative taxonomic classification listed in Lado & Eliasson.

MyxoSSU can be used to help researchers accurately annotate myxomycetes down to the species level.
