# MyxoSSU
A Manually-curated Database for Bright and Dark-spored Myxomycetes based on the 18S rRNA gene

This database contains 1,103 extracted 18S SSU rRNA gene sequences with representatives from both bright and dark-spored clades. 
Sequences included in this database were retrieved from peer-reviewed barcoding studies and were manually classified based on the authoritative taxonomic classification listed in Lado & Eliasson (2022).

MyxoSSU can be used to help researchers accurately annotate myxomycetes down to the species level. 

Included in this repository are the MyxoSSU database, the computer codes, and other data generated during the study.
